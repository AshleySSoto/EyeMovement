# EyeMovement
This was a fun project, learning to duplicate the original code to make two idental moving eyes that follow the mouse. Now it can get a bit annoying having the eyes follow your every movement. One of the instructors offered a button to stop the eyes from moving, that is not dded in this code. 
I'm not really sure what this could be used for in the every day coding most people do. It is great if you need identical images, other than that, not to much it can be used for.
